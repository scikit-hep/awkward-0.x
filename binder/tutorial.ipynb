        "\n",
        "you might first compute :math:`\\\\sqrt{(p_{x1} + p_{x2})^2 + (p_{y1} + p_{y2})^2}` for all data (which is a meaningful quantity: :math:`p_T`), then compute :math:`\\\\sqrt{{p_T}^2 + (p_{z1} + p_{z2})^2}` for all data (another meaningful quantity: :math:`|p|`), then compute the whole expression as :math:`\\\\sqrt{(E_1 + E_2)^2 - |p|^2}`. Performing each step separately on all data lets you plot and cross-check distributions of partial computations, to discover surprises as early as possible.\n",

        "This order of data processing is called \"columnar\" in the sense that a dataset may be visualized as a table in which rows are repeated measurements and columns are the different measurable quantities (same layout as `Pandas DataFrames <https://pandas.pydata.org>`__). It is also called \"vectorized\" in that a Single (virtual) Instruction is applied to Multiple Data (virtual SIMD). Numpy can be hundreds to thousands of times faster than pure Python because it avoids the overhead of handling Python instructions in the loop over numbers. Most data processing languages (R, MATLAB, IDL, all the way back to APL) work this way: an interactive interpreter controlling fast, array-at-a-time math.\n",

        "In this sense, Numpy arrays are awkward-array's most basic array class. A Numpy array is a small Python object that points to a large, contiguous region of memory, and, as much as possible, operations replace or change the small Python object, not the big data buffer. Therefore, many Numpy operations are *views*, rather than *in-place operations* or *copies*, leaving the original value intact but returning a new value that is linked to the original. Assigning to arrays and in-place operations are allowed, but they are more complicated to use because one must be aware of which arrays are views and which are copies.\n",
        "\n",
        "Awkward-array's model is to treat all arrays as though they were immutable, favoring views over copies, and not providing any high-level in-place operations on low-level memory buffers (i.e. no in-place assignment).\n",
        "\n",
        "Numpy provides complete control over the interpretation of an ``N`` dimensional array. A Numpy array has a `dtype <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/arrays.dtypes.html>`__ to interpret bytes as signed and unsigned integers of various bit-widths, floating-point numbers, booleans, little endian and big endian, fixed-width bytestrings (for applications such as 6-byte MAC addresses or human-readable strings with padding), or `record arrays <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/basics.rec.html>`__ for contiguous structures. A Numpy array has a `pointer <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.ctypes.html>`__ to the first element of its data buffer (``array.ctypes.data``) and a `shape <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.shape.html>`__ to describe its ``N`` dimensions as a rank-``N`` tensor. Only ``shape[0]`` is the length as returned by the Python function ``len``. Furthermore, an `order <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.flags.html>`__ flag determines if rank > 1 arrays are laid out in \"C\" order or \"Fortran\" order. A Numpy array also has a `stride <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.strides.html>`__` to determine how many bytes separate one element from the next. (Data in a Numpy array need not be strictly contiguous, but they must be regular: the number of bytes seprating them is a constant.) This stride may even be negative to describe a reversed view of an array, which allows any ``slice`` of an array, even those with ``skip != 1`` to be a view, rather than a copy. Numpy arrays also have flags to determine whether they `own <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.flags.html>`__` their data buffer (and should therefore delete it when the Python object goes out of scope) and whether the data buffer is `writable <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.flags.html>`__.\n"

Awkward's ``JaggedArray`` is a generalization of Numpy's rank-2 arrays—that is, arrays of arrays—in that the inner arrays of a ``JaggedArray`` may all have different lengths. For higher ranks, such as arrays of arrays of arrays, put a ``JaggedArray`` inside another as its ``content``. An important special case of ``JaggedArray`` is ``StringArray``, whose ``content`` is interpreted as characters (with or without encoding), which represents an array of strings without unnecessary padding, as in Numpy's case.\n",

Awkward's ``Table`` provides the same interface, except that each column may be anywhere in memory, stored in a ``contents`` dict mapping field names to arrays. This is a true generalization: a ``Table`` may be a wrapped view of a Numpy record array, but not vice-versa. Use a ``Table`` anywhere you'd have a record/class/struct in non-columnar data structures.

Naturally, the only kinds of arrays Numpy can mask are subclasses of its own ``ndarray``, and we need to be able to mask any awkward array, so the awkward library defines its own ``MaskedArray``. Additionally, we sometimes want to mask with bits, rather than bytes (e.g. for Arrow compatibility), so there's a ``BitMaskedArray``, and sometimes we want to mask large structures without using memory for the masked-out values, so there's an ``IndexedMaskedArray`` (fusing the functionality of a ``MaskedArray`` with an ``IndexedArray``).\n",

As a data type, unions are a counterpart to records or tuples (making ``UnionArray`` a counterpart to ``Table``): each record/tuple contains *all* of its ``contents`` but a union contains *any* of its ``contents``.

Therefore, awkward arrays can also have vectorized ``Methods``—bound functions that operate on the array data, rather than instantiating every Python object in an ``ObjectArray``. Although an ``ObjectArray`` is a good use-case for ``Methods``, any awkward array can have them. (The second most common case being a ``JaggedArray`` of ``ObjectArrays``.)\n",

        "The nesting of awkward arrays within awkward arrays need not be tree-like: they can have cross-references and cyclic references (using ordinary Python assignment). ``IndexedArray`` can aid in building complex structures: it is simply an integer ``index`` that would be applied to its ``content`` with `integer array indexing <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/arrays.indexing.html#integer-array-indexing>`__ to get any element. ``IndexedArray`` is the equivalent of a pointer in non-columnar data structures.\n",

Awkward's ``SparseArray`` is a `coordinate format (COO) <https://scipy-lectures.org/advanced/scipy_sparse/coo_matrix.html>`__, one-dimensional array.\n",

In most libraries, lazy-loading is not a part of the data but a feature of the reading interface.

        "\n",
        "There are three levels of abstraction in awkward-array: high-level operations for data analysis, low-level operations for engineering the structure of the data, and implementation details. Implementation details are handled in the usual way for Python: if exposed at all, class, method, and function names begin with underscores and are not guaranteed to be stable from one release to the next. There is more than one implementation of awkward: the original awkward library, which depends only on Numpy, awkward-numba, which uses Numba to just-in-time compile its operations, and awkward-cpp, which has precompiled operations. Each has its own implementation details.\n",
        "\n",
        "The distinction between high-level operations and low-level operations is more subtle and developed as awkward-array was put to use. Data analysts care about the logical structure of the data—whether it is jagged, what the column names are, whether certain values could be ``None``, etc. Data engineers (or an analyst in \"engineering mode\") care about contiguousness, how much data are in memory at a given time, whether strings are dictionary-encoded, whether arrays have unreachable elements, etc. The dividing line is between high-level types and low-level array layout (both of which are defined in their own sections below). The following awkward classes have the same high-level type as their content:\n",

        "* ``IndexedArray`` because indirection to type ``T`` has type ``T``,\n",
        "* ``SparseArray`` because a lookup of elements with type ``T`` has type ``T``,\n",
        "* ``ChunkedArray`` because the chunks, which must have the same type as each other, collectively have that type when logically concatenated,\n",
        "* ``AppendableArray`` because it's a special case of ``ChunkedArray``,\n",
        "* ``VirtualArray`` because it produces an array of a given type on demand,\n",

For some high-level types, the operation is meaningless or results in an error, such as the jagged ``counts`` of an array that is not jagged at any level, or the ``columns`` of an array that contains no tables, but the operation has a well-defined action on every array class. To use these operations, you do need to understand the high-level type of your data, but not whether it is wrapped in an ``IndexedArray``, a ``SparseArray``, a ``ChunkedArray``, an ``AppendableArray``, or a ``VirtualArray``.\n"
